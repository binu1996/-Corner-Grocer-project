- ## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The main task in this project is to build an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer. This project requires to use both C++ and Python to create a program that analyzes the text records the store generate throughout the day. The program includes how often each item was purchased, how many times a specific item was purchased in each day and a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day. 

- ## What did you do particularly well?

In this project, something I did well was creating the loop for menu options and designing it neatly. 

- ## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Something I could do to enhance my code is to write a code that is more efficient for input validation. That way we can ensure that the data entered by a user is acceptable.  For an example, in this program you were ask for an input between 1 and 4, an input validation algorithm would be used to ensure that values below 1 and above 4 were rejected.

- ## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging piece of the code I had to write was to read the frequency.dat file and create the histogram. It was difficult because my loop to read the name and frequency on each row from the newly created file didn't work at the beginning. I had search online for help and I found how to correctly write a loop to create a histogram.

- ## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The main skills from this project I will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work would be linking between the two languages. I really enjoyed learning how to integrate two programming languages together. The ability to use more than one language in a project is valuable for my future projects or courses. 

- ## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I used industry standard best practices such as in-line comments and appropriate naming conventions to make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
